He was given a minimum tariff of 12 years.</paragraph><paragraph>The Big Issue founder John Bird said following the deaths, there were a number of people at the magazine organisation who said it \"can't leave people in this situation\".</paragraph><paragraph>He added: \"I found it very difficult because being the person who put the whole thing together, I thought... maybe I shouldn't have bothered.</paragraph><paragraph>\"When we thought about it, obviously when you've got 22 years [of The Big Issue] and you look at the amount of people who have been injured and hurt and the people who have been killed, it's a very small amount for that amount of time.</paragraph><paragraph>\"But every time somebody gets attacked or murdered, you do stop and think. It wouldn't be human not to stop and think 'isn't there another way to do it?'\" </paragraph><crosshead>'Incredibly dangerous'</crosshead><paragraph>The magazine is sold on the streets by homeless people, who themselves have to initially buy the copies for 50% of the cover price. The intention is that the vendors earn money but also take charge of their finances, develop coping skills and boost their self-esteem.</paragraph><paragraph>But Mr Bird said the charity was now \"building other ways\" of working with homeless people by \"turning them into content providers\" for The Big Issue's digital magazine.</paragraph><paragraph>\"So some people could come to us and say 'we want to do things but we don't want to sell on the streets',\" he said.</paragraph><paragraph>\"The streets are incredibly dangerous. They always have been. They always will be. But the way in which The Big Issue has rallied I think is exemplary. </paragraph><image id=\"65251617\"/><paragraph>\"The public were enormously supportive of our staff and our vendors, so we kind of weathered it, but it raises very big issues that I've been working on for a few years because I'm an ex-runaway and rough sleeper and I knew how vulnerable it was [on the streets].\"</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Bird said staff took what happened \"very, very badly\" and the organisation \"had to do a lot of hand holding because they knew the vendors very well\".</paragraph><paragraph>The Big Issue runs \"a very tight\" street support service, he added, but it was \"very difficult to protect people from the public\".</paragraph><paragraph>The magazine founder said: \"I don't know what else we could do.</paragraph><paragraph>\"We will always be vulnerable to some random person who may have had some great problem in their lives which has led them to become psychotic.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Bird said he used to see people who were mentally ill on the streets and who \"are harming themselves and could possibly harm others\".</paragraph><paragraph>He said: \"If I had my way, I'd pick all these people up and take them to a place of safety. I wouldn't put them back in the old asylums. </paragraph><paragraph>\"I would put them in a place of safety where they don't harm other people and they don't harm themselves.\"</paragraph></body>",
