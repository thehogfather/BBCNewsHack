We're approaching them.</paragraph><paragraph>\"There's a lot of prejudice towards people - homeless people, Big Issue sellers. The average person in the street thinks that like homeless people... are not our problem.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Fellow Big Issue vendor Adrian Smith, 40, who was homeless on and off for about eight or nine years before getting involved with the Big Issue, said he had sometimes felt threatened as a seller.</paragraph><paragraph>Speaking on New Street, one of the areas where he regularly sells the paper, Mr Smith said he gets \"sarcasm\" and disagreements, but \"nothing major like violence\".</paragraph><paragraph>He added: \"[I've] just had the unpleasant remarks and stuff like that off people, but you just tend to brush it off, don't you? </paragraph><paragraph>\"If I feel uncomfortable, I just normally like move on and then come back to my pitch a bit later on.\" </paragraph><crosshead>'Nice blokes'</crosshead><paragraph>Several people who work in the centre of Birmingham said relations with Big Issue vendors were generally good.</paragraph><image id=\"65266920\"/><paragraph>Dave Evans, who works at Millets on Union Street, near where both men were stabbed, said a few of the Big Issue sellers occasionally came into the store, but he was not aware of any trouble in the area.</paragraph><paragraph>\"There are a few problems with beggars, but the Big Issue sellers are nice blokes,\" he said.  \"They've never talked about having problems.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Andrew Wale, 30, who also works on Union Street, said there was generally a positive attitude towards Big Issue sellers in the area.</paragraph><paragraph>\"They come across really nice, friendly to talk to, but when I heard about it I was really scared to come to work myself on Saturday,\" he said.</paragraph><crosshead>Twitter abuse</crosshead><paragraph>Big Issue sellers are not the only workers operating on the country's streets.</paragraph><paragraph>Rory White from Flow Caritas, a charity recruitment agency, said street fundraisers were far more likely to experience abuse than those working door-to-door.</paragraph><paragraph>\"It happens more on streets, partly because people think they are more anonymous,\" he said.</paragraph><paragraph>\"We have to take safety very seriously. There's always a briefing beforehand and people work in teams in well-lit, busy areas.\"</paragraph><paragraph>The Public Fundraising Regulatory Association (PFRA), said violence towards so-called charity muggers, or chuggers, was very rare, although in one case a few years ago a woman had mace sprayed in her face.</paragraph><paragraph>The charity-led body which regulates face-to-face fundraising said abuse of chuggers on social media sites such as Twitter was becoming more common and more explicitly violent in its content.</paragraph></body>",
